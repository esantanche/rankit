# Project Title

RankIt!

## What the applications will do

This is a demonstration project. It's about using React and some other technologies to showcase some interesting possibilities.

Images of products will be fetched from a server. The user will be able to rank the products by dragging and dropping them.

The rank the user defines will be stored in the browser local storage so that the user will find the products ranked in the
way they ranked it when they visit the website again later.

## Technologies used:

* React
* React Material Design
* React Motion
* React Router
* React Drag and Drop
* Drupal 8 (not used yet)
* Jest (not used yet)
